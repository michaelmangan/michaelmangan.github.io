## Michael Mangan's Webpage

I am a lecturer in the [Dept. of Computer Science](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs) at the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/), UK, and also a member of [Sheffield Robotics](https://www.sheffieldrobotics.ac.uk/).  My current research projects are focussed on revealing how insights use vision to solve problems that we face in engineering such as navigation, and object detection, identification, and tracking. Revealing how insects achieve these feats is of scientific  interest in itself but also has application areas in areas from robot navigation, to smart agriculture.  Our [organisation page](https://github.com/ManganLab/manganlab.github.io) has a list of my research projects and group members.

Bio:

I received an undergraduate MEng in Avionics from the University of Glasgow in 2004, that included a final year placement at The Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.  I then moved academic fields by completing an MSc in Neuroinformatics (2006) and PhD in biorobotics (2011) at the University of Edinburgh.  I remained in Edinburgh for 4 further years as post-doc and research fellow on BBSRC and EPSRC grants.  In April, 2016 I took up a Senior Lecturer position at the Dept of Computer Science, University of Lincoln and joined the Lincoln Centre for Autonomous Systems research team.  Two years later, in April, 2018 I joined the Dept of Computer Science at the University of Sheffield as a Lecturer in Machine Learning and Robotics and also became a member of Sheffield Robotics.
