###  Background

I am a lecturer in Machine Learning and Robotics at the [Dept. of Computer Science](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs) at the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/), UK, and a member of [Sheffield Robotics](https://www.sheffieldrobotics.ac.uk/).  My current research focusses on revealing how insects use vision to solve complex problems such as navigation, and object detection, classification and tracking. Revealing how insects achieve these feats merits scientific investigation in itself but also has applications in domains such as autonmous navigation and smart agriculture.  Our [organisation page](https://manganlab.github.io) details the lab's research projects and group members.

###  Biography

I received an undergraduate MEng in Avionics from the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/) in 2004, during which I completed a final year placement at [The Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway](https://www.ntnu.edu/) .  I then moved location and academic fields by completing an MSc in Neuroinformatics (2006) and PhD in Biorobotics (2011) at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/home) under the supervision of Prof Barbara Webb.  I remained in Edinburgh for 4 further years as post-doc and research fellow on BBSRC and EPSRC grants.  In 2016 I took up a senior lecturer position at the [Dept of Computer Science, University of Lincoln](https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/home/socs/)  and joined the [Lincoln Centre for Autonomous Systems](https://lcas.lincoln.ac.uk/wp/category/lcas/) .  Two years later, I joined the [Dept. of Computer Science](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs) at the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/) where I am currently leading a research group in insect biorobotics.
