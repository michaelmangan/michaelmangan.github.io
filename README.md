## Michael Mangan's Webpage

I am a lecturer in the [Link](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs) Dept. of Computer Science at the University of Sheffield, UK.  My research largely focusses on learning how insights use their visual sensing to solve problems that we face in engineering  such as navigation, and object detection, identification, and tracking. A list of projects and members of my group can be found at our organisation page -> 

Bio:

I received an undergraduate MEng in Avionics from the University of Glasgow in 2004, that included a final year placement at The Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.  I then moved academic fields by completing an MSc in Neuroinformatics (2006) and PhD in biorobotics (2011) at the University of Edinburgh.  I remained in Edinburgh for 4 further years as post-doc and research fellow on BBSRC and EPSRC grants.  In April, 2016 I took up a Senior Lecturer position at the Dept of Computer Science, University of Lincoln and joined the Lincoln Centre for Autonomous Systems research team.  Two years later, in April, 2018 I joined the Dept of Computer Science at the University of Sheffield as a Lecturer in Machine Learning and Robotics and also became a member of Sheffield Robotics.
